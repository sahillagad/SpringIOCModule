Configuration Different Type Of Dependencies INspring Application 

without touching our class we reach all the dependencies is called a dependency resolution

in a spring application on every instance variable defined as a spring Bean class can be the considered as a dependency


spring Bean has 3 types of dependency

1] simple value type dependency
                    primitive type and string type
                    Example -: int float double char string

2] user-defined object type dependency
                    here We Create various classes like student, Employee,Collage

3] collection type of dependency
                    Normal Array
                    List 
                    Map
                    set
                    map

instance variable means any variable you define inside the class

public class MyBusinessClass{

//simple value type dependency
int num;
string name;




//user-defined object type dependency
Student stu;
Collage coll;





// collection type of dependency
List<String> names;
int[] array;
